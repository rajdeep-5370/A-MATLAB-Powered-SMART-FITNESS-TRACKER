# A-MATLAB-Powered-SMART-FITNESS-TRACKER

Built something exciting with my team AlgoRhythms 👇

We developed a Smart Fitness Tracker using MATLAB that accurately tracks steps, distance, stair climbs, calories burned, and automatically classifies activities like walking, running, stairs, and sitting — using only smartphone sensor data.

🔍 What makes it different?

 • Peak & prominence–based step detection (noise-resistant)

 • GPS distance using the Haversine formula

 • Altitude-based stair detection (ignores false climbs)

 • MET-based calorie estimation

 • Rule-based activity fingerprinting (intensity + shakiness)

 • Rich MATLAB visualizations (heat maps, step graphs, clusters)

This project was built as part of a hackathon, focusing on making fitness tracking accurate, affordable, and explainable — without relying on expensive wearables or black-box ML models.
